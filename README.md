## Project Overview

**Gratia** is a full-stack cloud-native web platform designed to facilitate food donations by connecting restaurants and catering services with NGOs. This platform aims to reduce food waste and help distribute surplus food efficiently to those in need.

Restaurants can list their excess food donations, and NGOs can browse, filter by location, and claim these donations on a first-come, first-served basis. The platform includes features like real-time location filtering, navigation via maps, and a messaging system to facilitate communication between donors and recipients.

This project is built using modern DevOps practices including containerization, orchestration, and automated CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliability and scalability.

## Features

- **Restaurant Portal:** List and manage surplus food donations.
- **NGO Portal:** Browse and claim food donations with location-based filtering.
- **Real-time Location Mapping:** Integrated maps to visualize donation and pickup locations.
- **Messaging System:** Direct communication channel between restaurants and NGOs.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Modular services for scalability and maintainability.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes (EKS).
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning.
- **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions for build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Prometheus and Grafana integration for observability.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust data storage and querying.

## Architecture

Gratia follows a microservices architecture where different functionalities such as user management, donation management, messaging, and notifications are handled by separate services communicating via REST APIs. The services run inside Docker containers deployed on Kubernetes managed by Amazon EKS, ensuring high availability and scalability.

Infrastructure provisioning is automated using Terraform, allowing easy environment setup and management. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines ensure automated testing and smooth updates.
